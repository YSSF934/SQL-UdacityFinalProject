# Udiddit- A Social News Aggregator
This is a **SQL**-based project, completed in terms of the requirements of **Udacity's** SQL nanodegree program. This repo contains all the **SQL** code (which consists of **DQL**, **DDL** and **DML**) necessary for the project. 

## Project Information 
This project focuses on Database Management Systems, specifically on relational databases. You assume the role of a data engineer with 3 tasks to be fulfilled. As a data engineer, you are required to build the supporting data structures for **udiddit**, a social news aggregation site which is very similar to *reddit*.

**udiddit** has registered users, and these users can post content (be it external or original content). Other users can vote on these posts by either upvoting or downvoting them. Users also have the ability to comment on posts. udiddit is currently using a **Postgres** database schema to store all the data relating to the application.

### Project Task 1 
The first task to be completed is the investigation of the existing data structure. As a data engineer, you are are required to identify any/all potential errors and issues within the data model, which could include things like the presence of denormalised data, consistency rules and incorrect indexing.

## Contributions 
**Udiddit** is a project that was completed as part of **Udacity's** *SQL* nanodegree program.

### Project Task 2
The second task featured a list of queries that Udiddit needs in order to support its website and administrative interface. Note that students were not required to produce the DQL for those queries. The queries were used to guide the design of the new database schema.  Normalization, various constraints, as well as indexes are used in the new database schema. Named constraints and indexes are applied to make the schema cleaner.

### Project Task 3
The final task was to write the DML to migrate the current data in bad_posts and bad_comments to my new database schema
