# Udiddit- A Social News Aggregator
This is a **SQL**-based project, completed in terms of the requirements of **Udacity's** SQL nanodegree program. This repo contains all the **SQL** code (which consists of **DQL**, **DDL** and **DML**) necessary for the project. In order to prevent plagiarism, the final written **report** is not included within this repo.

## Project Information 
This project focuses on Database Management Systems, specifically on relational databases. You assume the role of a data engineer with 3 tasks to be fulfilled. As a data engineer, you are required to build the supporting data structures for **udiddit**, a social news aggregation site which is very similar to *reddit*.

**udiddit** has registered users, and these users can post content (be it external or original content). Other users can vote on these posts by either upvoting or downvoting them. Users also have the ability to comment on posts. udiddit is currently using a **Postgres** database schema to store all the data relating to the application.

### Project Task 1 
The first task to be completed is the investigation of the existing data structure. As a data engineer, you are are required to identify any/all potential errors and issues within the data model, which could include things like the presence of denormalised data, consistency rules and incorrect indexing.

## Contributions
